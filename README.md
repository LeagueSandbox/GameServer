# Running the game client

#### Automatically Launching from Visual Studio or GameServerConsole.exe
Click the debug button.
> Auto run settings are located in `GameServer/GameServerConsole/bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.0/Settings/GameServerSettings.json`, there is where you'll set the path to your League of Legends' deploy folder, which shown by the example already in the file.

#### Manually Launching from command line
```
cd "Path/To/Your/League420/RADS/solutions/lol_game_client_sln/releases/0.0.1.68/deploy/"
start "" "League of Legends.exe" "" "" "" "127.0.0.1 5119 17BLOhi6KZsTtldTsizvHg== 1"
```

#### Manually Launching from command line (Linux)
* Install wine and winetricks using your package manager.
* Run ```winetricks d3dx9``` - without this you will get into the game, but your screen will be black.
* Mark .exe files executable by running ```find . -type f -iname "*.exe" -exec chmod +x {} \;``` in your League-of-Legends-4-20 directory.
* Enter the directory containing the client by running ```cd /path/to/your/League-of-Legends-4-20/RADS/solutions/lol_game_client_sln/releases/0.0.1.68/deploy/```
* Run the game:
